### Problem Title: "Counting the Visible Unicorns in a Dense Forest v2"

---

### Problem Statement:

There is a mystical forest where unicorns live, and you are tasked with counting how many unicorns are visible from your current position. However, seeing a unicorn is not as simple as it soundsâ€”there are several mystical rules that govern their visibility.

The forest is represented as a 2D grid of size `n x n`, where each cell either contains a tree (`T`), a unicorn (`U`), or an empty space (`.`). You can start at **any position** `(r_start, c_start)` in the grid. From your current position, you can see in all four cardinal directions (north, south, west, east) and the four diagonal directions (north-east, north-west, south-east, south-west).

**Visibility is affected by several mystical rules:**
1. You can only see a unicorn if the sum of its row and column indices is a **prime number**. If the sum is not prime, the unicorn is invisible to you.
2. If the **Manhattan distance** between you and a unicorn is a multiple of 7, magical interference renders that unicorn invisible.
3. Any unicorn located on the diagonal where `row == col` casts an invisibility shield, making **all other unicorns in its row and column invisible**.
4. If you can see more than two unicorns **in any single direction** (i.e., in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), all of the unicorns in that direction phase out and become invisible due to overcrowding in their mystical visibility spectrum.
5. Trees (`T`) block your line of sight. If a tree appears in any direction, you cannot see past it in that direction. **If a tree is present at your starting position, it does not block your vision**, and you can still see outward in all directions as if you were standing on an empty space.

Your task is to return the number of unicorns visible from your starting position `(r_start, c_start)` after applying all the above rules.

### Input:

- `forest` (list of list of strings): A 2D list of strings representing the forest grid. It contains:
  - `'T'`: A tree that blocks your vision.
  - `'U'`: A unicorn.
  - `'.'`: An empty space.
  
- `r_start` (int): The row index of your starting position.
- `c_start` (int): The column index of your starting position.

### Output:

- An integer representing the number of unicorns visible from the given starting position `(r_start, c_start)` after applying all the mystical rules above.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= r_start, c_start < n`
- At most 10% of the grid cells contain unicorns.
- Trees can appear anywhere, including on your starting position.

### Example:

#### Input:
```python
forest = [
  ['U', '.', 'T', 'U', '.', '.', 'T'],
  ['T', '.', 'T', '.', 'U', '.', '.'],
  ['.', 'U', '.', '.', '.', 'T', '.'],
  ['.', '.', 'U', 'T', '.', 'U', '.'],
  ['U', '.', 'T', '.', '.', '.', 'U'],
  ['.', 'T', '.', 'U', '.', '.', 'T'],
  ['U', '.', 'U', '.', 'T', '.', '.']
]
r_start = 3
c_start = 4
```

#### Output:
```
1
```

#### Explanation:

- You are standing at `(3, 4)`.
- The tree to the west at `(3, 3)` blocks further visibility in that direction, so the unicorn behind it at `(3, 2)` is not visible.
- The unicorn at `(1, 4)` to the north has a row + column sum of 5, which is prime, and your Manhattan distance to it is 2, which is not a multiple of 7, so it is visible to you.
- The unicorn at `(3, 5)` to the east has a row + column sum of 8, which is not prime, so it is invisible.
- No unicorns are visible in any other direction.
- There is only one unicorn on the diagonal at `(0, 0)`, and the invisibility shield that it casts does not affect any unicorns in your line of sight.
- There are no more than 2 unicorns visible in a single direction to you, so we do not apply rule 4.
- After all the rules, only one unicorn remains visible.
